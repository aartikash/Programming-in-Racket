# Programming in Racket Experience Reports
A blog for writing experience reports for different things that I keep trying and learning
functional languages and how to design languages in Racket, which I am convinced is an 
amazing programming language because of the beautiful abstractions it offers. 


Some thoughts on specific features of Racket. This is repo mostly for my personal learning. 
I am mostly writing based on different sources that I read to answer my questions. However,
if any inaccuracies spotted please do report. 
 

Feel free to use it and/or submit issues if found.
